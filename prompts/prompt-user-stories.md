immigration clients with licensed Regulated Canadian Immigration
Consultants (RCICs) in Canada. Think "Upwork for immigration
consultants."

I need an experienced full-stack developer to build the MVP
(Minimum Viable Product) from scratch.

WHAT I NEED BUILT:

This is a marketplace platform with 3 user types:

1. Clients (people seeking immigration services)
2. RCICs (immigration consultants)
3. Admin (me)

CORE FEATURES:

✓ User Authentication & Profiles
  - Sign up / Login (email + Google OAuth)
  - Separate dashboards for Clients, RCICs, and Admin
  - Profile management (photo, bio, credentials)

  - Filter by: specialty, language, location, price, rating
  - Sort by: rating, price, experience, availability
  - RCIC profile pages with detailed information

✓ Booking System
  - Calendar showing RCIC availability
  - Time slot selection
  - Consultation type selection (video/phone/in-person)
  - Booking confirmation with details

✓ Payment Processing
  - Stripe integration (I already have Stripe account)
  - Secure payment for consultations
  - Automatic commission split (platform takes 20%, RCIC gets 80%)
  - Payment confirmation emails

✓ Review & Rating System

  - Text reviews from clients
  - Display average rating on RCIC profiles
  - Sort RCICs by rating
