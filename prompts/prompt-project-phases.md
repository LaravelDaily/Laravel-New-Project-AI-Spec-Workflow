Plan this project into phases and what needs to be built. I want to have a complete task list that needs to happen, based on `@docs/user-stories.md`, `@docs/project-description.md` and `@docs/database-schema.md`.

For phases and sub-phases, use numeration like "Phase 1" or "Phase 5.3" so they could be referenced by numbers, when later given to AI agent to implement.

Check in the code, which tasks are already completed, and mark them accordingly.
Put the result into `@docs/project-phases.md`.

## Technical Detail

If project uses Livewire starter kit, then create new pages as Laravel Controllers and not as Livewire components, unless specifically stated otherwise or unless dynamic Livewire behavior is required on that page.
